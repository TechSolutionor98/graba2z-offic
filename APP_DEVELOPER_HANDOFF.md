# GrabA2Z App Developer Handoff

## Objective
When a user registers from mobile app and places an app order, backend applies admin-managed App Discount automatically.

## Base URL
- Production API: `https://api.grabatoz.ae`
- All endpoints below are relative to that base URL.

## 1) Register User as App User
Endpoint:
- `POST /api/users/register`

Send this payload from app signup:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPassword123",
  "registrationSource": "app",
  "registrationPlatform": "android"
}
```

Notes:
- `registrationSource` must be `"app"`.
- `registrationPlatform` must be `"android"` or `"ios"`.
- If you miss these fields, user may be treated as web user and app discount might not apply.

## 2) Login
Endpoint:
- `POST /api/users/login`

Use returned `token` as Bearer token for authenticated calls.

## 3) Preview App Discount (Optional but Recommended)
Endpoint:
- `POST /api/app-discounts/preview`

Headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Body:
```json
{
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "product": "665f1b8f1b9d2449e5d8d111",
      "price": 1200,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Possible response (example):
```json
{
  "applied": true,
  "discountAmount": 120,
  "eligibleSubtotal": 1200,
  "discount": {
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "New App User Offer",
    "appliesTo": "all",
    "discountType": "percentage",
    "discountValue": 10
  }
}
```

## 4) Create Order (Discount Applied Server-Side)
Endpoint:
- `POST /api/orders`

Headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required for app discount eligibility)
- Optional fallback header: `X-Order-Source: app`

Body must include:
- `orderSource: "app"`
- `orderItems`
- `itemsPrice`
- `shippingPrice`
- `totalPrice`
- `deliveryType`
- `shippingAddress` (for home delivery) or `pickupDetails` (for pickup)

Example:
```json
{
  "orderSource": "app",
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "product": "665f1b8f1b9d2449e5d8d111",
      "price": 1200,
      "quantity": 1,
      "image": "https://..."
    }
  ],
  "itemsPrice": 1200,
  "shippingPrice": 25,
  "totalPrice": 1225,
  "deliveryType": "home",
  "shippingAddress": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "0500000000",
    "address": "Street 1",
    "city": "Dubai",
    "state": "Dubai",
    "zipCode": "00000"
  },
  "paymentMethod": "cod",
  "actualPaymentMethod": "cod"
}
```

## 5) What Backend Does Automatically
On app order creation:
- Detects app source (`orderSource` or header fallback).
- Checks user is app-registered (`registrationSource = app`).
- Finds active admin-configured App Discount.
- Validates eligibility (new app user / selected products / date window / limits).
- Applies discount server-side.

Order response includes fields like:
- `discountAmount`
- `appDiscountApplied`
- `appDiscountId`
- `appDiscountName`
- `appDiscountType`
- `appDiscountValue`
- `appDiscountAmount`
- `totalPrice` (final server-calculated total)

## 6) Critical Integration Rules
1. Do not hardcode app discount logic on mobile app.
2. Always trust backend response totals.
3. Always send `registrationSource: "app"` at signup.
4. Always send `orderSource: "app"` at order creation.
5. Use authenticated user token for app orders.

## 7) Optional Public Endpoint for Display
Endpoint:
- `GET /api/app-discounts/active`

Use this if app wants to show current app-offer text to users.

## 8) Web Popup Links (for website team/env)
Website popup reads:
- `VITE_ANDROID_APP_URL`
- `VITE_IOS_APP_URL`

Set these in client environment so Play Store / App Store buttons are active.
