# GrabA2Z App First-User Discount - Full Integration Guide

## 1) Objective
Show first-user app discount in mobile app, apply it on first eligible app order, and automatically remove/hide it after user uses it or becomes ineligible.

---

## 2) What is Already Implemented (Backend)

### User tracking
`POST /api/users/register` now supports:
- `registrationSource`: `"app" | "web"`
- `registrationPlatform`: `"android" | "ios"`

When app sends `registrationSource: "app"`, backend stores user as app-registered.

### App discount management
- Admin can create/manage app discounts from `/admin/app-discounts`.
- Discounts can be:
  - all products
  - selected products
  - percentage or fixed
  - only new app users
  - single-use
  - date range + priority

### Order-time discount application
`POST /api/orders` applies app discount server-side when:
- user is authenticated
- `orderSource` is `"app"` (or `X-Order-Source: app`)
- user is app-registered
- discount rule matches

Order response contains:
- `appDiscountApplied`
- `appDiscountAmount`
- `appDiscountId`
- `appDiscountName`
- `appDiscountType`
- `appDiscountValue`
- `discountAmount`
- final `totalPrice`

## 3) APIs App Developer Must Use

## A) Register app user
### Endpoint
`POST /api/users/register`

### Body
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPassword123",
  "registrationSource": "app",
  "registrationPlatform": "android"
}
```

> Important: If app does not send `registrationSource: "app"`, first-user app discount will not be eligible.

---

## B) Show first-user discount status (new API)
### Endpoint
`GET /api/app-discounts/me/first-user-discount`

### Auth
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Success response (eligible)
```json
{
  "eligible": true,
  "reason": "eligible",
  "hasAnyOrder": false,
  "discount": {
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "First App Order 10%",
    "description": "...",
    "appliesTo": "all",
    "products": [],
    "discountType": "percentage",
    "discountValue": 10,
    "minOrderAmount": 0,
    "maxDiscountAmount": null,
    "onlyNewAppUsers": true,
    "singleUsePerUser": true,
    "startsAt": "...",
    "endsAt": "..."
  }
}
```

### Not eligible example
```json
{
  "eligible": false,
  "reason": "not_first_order_anymore",
  "hasAnyOrder": true
}
```

### Possible `reason` values
- `auth_required`
- `not_app_registered_user`
- `no_active_discount`
- `not_first_order_anymore`
- `no_matching_discount`

Use this API on app home/profile/cart badge to decide whether to show “First app order discount available”.

---

## C) Preview exact discount for current cart
### Endpoint
`POST /api/app-discounts/preview`

### Auth
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Body
```json
{
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "product": "665f1b8f1b9d2449e5d8d111",
      "price": 1200,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response (example)
```json
{
  "applied": true,
  "discountAmount": 120,
  "eligibleSubtotal": 1200,
  "discount": {
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "First App Order 10%",
    "appliesTo": "all",
    "discountType": "percentage",
    "discountValue": 10,
    "maxDiscountAmount": null,
    "onlyNewAppUsers": true,
    "singleUsePerUser": true
  }
}
```

Use this API in cart/checkout to show exact live discount amount before placing order.

---

## D) Place app order
### Endpoint
`POST /api/orders`

### Auth
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Required key for app source
- Body: `"orderSource": "app"`
- (Optional fallback header: `X-Order-Source: app`)

### Body (minimal example)
```json
{
  "orderSource": "app",
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "product": "665f1b8f1b9d2449e5d8d111",
      "price": 1200,
      "quantity": 1,
      "image": "https://..."
    }
  ],
  "itemsPrice": 1200,
  "shippingPrice": 25,
  "totalPrice": 1225,
  "deliveryType": "home",
  "shippingAddress": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "0500000000",
    "address": "Street 1",
    "city": "Dubai",
    "state": "Dubai",
    "zipCode": "00000"
  },
  "paymentMethod": "cod",
  "actualPaymentMethod": "cod"
}
```

Backend recalculates totals and applies app discount server-side.

## 4) Complete App Flow (What App Dev Should Do)

1. User signs up from app using `registrationSource: "app"`.
2. User logs in and gets token.
3. App calls `GET /api/app-discounts/me/first-user-discount`.
4. If `eligible: true`, show “First app order discount available”.
5. In cart/checkout, call `POST /api/app-discounts/preview` with cart items.
6. Show exact discount amount returned by preview.
7. Place order with `orderSource: "app"`.
8. Read order response fields `appDiscountApplied` + `appDiscountAmount` for success UI.
9. After successful order, call `GET /api/app-discounts/me/first-user-discount` again.
10. If now `eligible: false`, hide first-user discount badges from app.

---

## 5) How Discount Gets Removed After First Order
No manual app-side removal needed.
Backend checks user order history and discount usage rules:
- if `onlyNewAppUsers = true` and user already has an order => no longer eligible
- if `singleUsePerUser = true` and used discount once => no longer eligible

App just re-fetches status API and updates UI.

---

## 6) Backend Rules/Contract (Must not be bypassed)
- App must not hardcode discount math.
- Always trust backend preview and order response.
- App should treat backend `reason` as source of truth for eligibility state.

---

## 7) Admin Operations
Use admin panel:
- `/admin/app-discounts`

Admin config controls:
- discount value/type
- selected products vs all products
- first-user only
- single-use
- date window

No app release needed for offer changes.

---

## 8) If You Want Existing Web Users to Also Get App First-Order Discount
Current logic requires app registration source.
If business wants web-registered users to become app-eligible later, add a separate backend feature (not enabled now), e.g.:
- endpoint to mark user as app-registered on verified first app login
- guarded by device signature / OTP / business rule

---

## 9) Quick Test Checklist
1. Create active app discount from admin.
2. Register new user from app payload (`registrationSource: app`).
3. Call `GET /api/app-discounts/me/first-user-discount` => `eligible: true`.
4. Add cart and call preview => discount amount > 0.
5. Place order with `orderSource: app`.
6. Confirm order has `appDiscountApplied: true` and reduced `totalPrice`.
7. Call status API again => usually `eligible: false` for first-user discount.

## 10) Product Card Badge + Price Cutting (App UI Logic)

This is how app developer should show **New User Deal** on product cards.

### Step A: fetch current user discount status once
Call:
- `GET /api/app-discounts/me/first-user-discount`

Use response as `firstUserDiscountState`.

### Step B: decide if badge should be visible on each product card
Badge visible rules:
1. `firstUserDiscountState.eligible === true`
2. AND product matches discount scope:
   - if `discount.appliesTo === "all"` => all product cards show badge
   - if `discount.appliesTo === "products"` => only show badge for products whose `_id` is in `discount.products[]`

### Step C: show cut price on product card (estimated)
Use product selling price first:
- `basePrice = product.offerPrice > 0 ? product.offerPrice : product.price`

Then apply discount rule:
- if `discountType = percentage`:
  - `rawDiscount = basePrice * (discountValue / 100)`
- if `discountType = fixed`:
  - `rawDiscount = discountValue`

Apply max cap if exists:
- `effectiveDiscount = min(rawDiscount, maxDiscountAmount)` when cap is set

Final display price:
- `discountedPrice = max(0, basePrice - effectiveDiscount)`

For UI:
- show original price with strike-through
- show discounted price in green
- show small label: `New User Deal`

### Important note for app developer
Product-card discount is **display estimate**.
Final amount must always come from backend at checkout:
- `POST /api/app-discounts/preview` (cart-level exact amount)
- `POST /api/orders` (final server-applied discount in order response)

### Product card pseudocode (app side)
```js
function getProductCardDeal(product, state) {
  if (!state?.eligible || !state?.discount) {
    return { showBadge: false, showPriceCut: false }
  }

  const d = state.discount
  const productId = String(product._id)

  const matchesScope =
    d.appliesTo === "all" ||
    (d.appliesTo === "products" && Array.isArray(d.products) && d.products.map(String).includes(productId))

  if (!matchesScope) {
    return { showBadge: false, showPriceCut: false }
  }

  const basePrice = Number(product.offerPrice > 0 ? product.offerPrice : product.price)
  if (!Number.isFinite(basePrice) || basePrice <= 0) {
    return { showBadge: true, showPriceCut: false }
  }

  let rawDiscount = 0
  if (d.discountType === "percentage") rawDiscount = (basePrice * Number(d.discountValue || 0)) / 100
  else rawDiscount = Number(d.discountValue || 0)

  let effectiveDiscount = rawDiscount
  if (d.maxDiscountAmount != null && Number(d.maxDiscountAmount) > 0) {
    effectiveDiscount = Math.min(effectiveDiscount, Number(d.maxDiscountAmount))
  }

  const discountedPrice = Math.max(0, basePrice - Math.max(0, effectiveDiscount))

  return {
    showBadge: true,
    showPriceCut: discountedPrice < basePrice,
    originalPrice: basePrice,
    discountedPrice,
  }
}
```

### If discount has minimum order amount
If `discount.minOrderAmount > basePrice` for a single product card:
- still show badge (`New User Deal`)
- but price cut can be hidden until cart/checkout confirms eligibility
